# load all the control kallisto files 
# average the relative abundances, transcripts per million

# load the Allen Brain Atlas Structure Unionize csv file
# (maybe just the entrez gene IDs and the expression energy -- one measure)

# load the entrez/ensembl gene id map
# make a new table with ensembl id/expression energies

# make one more data-frame - tuples of tpm and ee ? maybe just data frame 

# run simple linear regression of these two variables -- need to decide which 
# one is dependent . . . 

# bootstrap?

# Next steps -- Run PCA, ICA, tSNE
